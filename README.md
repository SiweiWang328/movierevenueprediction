# Movie Revenue Prediction

The motion picture industry is a multibillion-dollar business. In 2018, the worldwide movie industry made an estimate $41.7 billion box office revenues. Nevertheless, the financial success of a movie is largely uncertain, with “hits” and “flops” released almost every year. From an investor’s standpoint, one would want to be as assured as possible that his/her investment will ultimately lead to returns. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget?
